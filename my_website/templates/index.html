        <h2>About Moose</h2>
        <p>Moose is a Labrador Retriever with the perfect mix of chill vibes and endless energy. Whether he's napping in a sunbeam or sprinting after a ball, he's always 100% himself. Goofy, vocal, and affectionate. He thinks he's a lap dog and will sit on you with zero awareness of his 80-pound body or where exactly he's sitting. Your face? Your stomach? Doesn't matter to him.</p>
